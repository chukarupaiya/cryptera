                        1. DALL-E: DALL-E is a deep learning models developed by OpenAI to generate digital images from natural language descriptions, called "prompts". DALL-E can generate imagery in multiple styles, including photorealistic imagery, paintings, and emoji. It can "manipulate and rearrange" objects in its images, and can correctly place design elements in novel compositions without explicit instruction.

                        2. Midjourney: Midjourney is an artificial intelligence program under the same name that creates images from textual descriptions (similar to DALL-E).

                        3. ChatGPT: ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer[2]) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI that can write and debug computer programs, compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker); write poetry and song lyrics. https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/
